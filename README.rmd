If you wish to run the app without installation and directly on the web go to one the following servers:

## [INFINITy web-application official server!](https://infinity.unlu.edu.ar/)

## [INFINITy web-application secondary server!](https://cacciabue.shinyapps.io/infinity/)

## :arrow_double_down: Installation

If you have a working R and Rstudio setup you
can install the released version of **`r app_name `** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")
  
devtools::install_github("marcocacciabue/infinity")
```
This could take several minutes depending on your system and installation. Only the first time it runs.

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a .zip file and install it manually with Rstudio.

## :computer: Deploying **`r app_name `**

To start the app simply run the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
infinity::runShinyApp()
```

:+1: You are ready to classify your data. 


## **`r app_name `** is an R package

This means that users that prefer working with a command-line interface can use some of the exported functions. We provide some basic usage of the functions: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# First we indicate the location of the fasta file. In this case, we use a test file provided with the package itself.
file_path<-system.file("extdata","test_dataset.fasta",package="infinity")

# We load the sequences
sequence<-ape::read.FASTA(file_path,type = "DNA")

# We the count and normalize the k-mers
NormalizedData <- Kcounter(SequenceData=sequence,model=FULL_HA)

# We perform the classification
PredictedData <- PredictionCaller(NormalizedData=NormalizedData,model=FULL_HA)

# The PredictedData dataframe contains the classifications and the control flags.

PredictedData
```

## :whale: Docker image available
Another way to run **`r app_name `** as a shiny app is to use the docker image. Follow these steps:

1.    If you don´t already have it, install docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started.
2.    Open a terminal and run the following:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
docker pull cacciabue/infinity:developing

```

and wait for the image to download. You only have to run this command the first time, or whenever you want to check for updates.

3.    Once the downloading is complete run the following:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
docker run -d --rm -p 3838:3838 cacciabue/infinity:developing

```

4.    Finally, open your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:3838/
5.    The app should be up and running in your browser. Load the fasta file and press RUN.
6.    You can save a report using the corresponding button.
