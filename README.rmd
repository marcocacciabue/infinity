If you wish to run the app without installation and directly on the web go to:

## [INFINITy web-application!](https://cacciabue.shinyapps.io/infinit/)

## :arrow_double_down: Installation

If you have a working R and Rstudio setup you
can install the released version of **`r app_name `** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")
  
devtools::install_github("marcocacciabue/infinity")
```
This could take several minutes depending on your system and installation. Only the first time it runs.

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a .zip file and install it manually with Rstudio.

## :computer: Deploying **`r app_name `**

To start the app simply run the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
infinity::runExample("app.R")
```

:+1: You are ready to classify your data. 

## :whale: Docker image available
Another way to run **`r app_name `** is to use the docker image. Follow these steps:

1.    If you donÂ´t already have it, install docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started.
2.    Open a terminal and run the following:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
docker pull cacciabue/infinity:latest

```

and wait for the image to download. You only have to run this command the first time, or whenever you want to check for updates.

3.    Once the downloading is complete run the following:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
docker run -d --rm -p 3838:3838 cacciabue/infinity:latest

```

4.    Finally, open your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:3838/
5.    The app should be up and running in your browser. Load the fasta file and press RUN.
