<p align="justify"> <span class="name_yellow">INF</span><span class="name_pink">INITy</span> is a fast and accurate tool for classifying human influenza A and B virus sequences into types, lineages, and clades.  It is an application based on an alignment-free machine learning algorithm that can classify both complete hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences or its first partial region (HA1). 
    Users need a FASTA file with influenza HA gene segment query sequences. Then, they have to select a model according to the length of the query sequences: Full-HA, for full HA sequence length of 1700 bp, or HA1, for partial HA sequence length of 1030 bp. The quality of the sequences must be good, with a proportion of N bases <1 %.</p>
<p align="justify">The influenza classification is based on the nomenclature proposed by the <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/vaccines/who-recommendations">World Health Organization</a> that is widely accepted and used throughout the world.  
    Both types of human influenza were included: A and B. Within human influenza A, two subtypes were included: A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), and within inINITyenza B, two lineages: B/Victoria and B/Yamagata. All human inINITyenza types were further classified into a total of 75 clades and subclades: 
    25 for A(H1N1)pdm09, 32 for A(H3N2), 14 for B/Victoria and 4 for B/Yamagata. In addition, some current subclades that make explicit the presence of certain marker amino acids were included.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="name_yellow">INF</span><span class="name_pink">INITy</span> was developed as a web-application, and is also available on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/infinit/">SourceForge</a></p>
