## :arrow\_double\_down: Installation

If you have a working R and Rstudio setup you you can install the

with:

``` r
if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("devtools")
  
devtools::install_github("marcocacciabue/infinity")

This could take several minutes depending on your system and
